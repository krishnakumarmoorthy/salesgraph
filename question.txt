DESCRIPTION
Write a Python code that reads the sales data of  an Automobile  company.
Plot the sales data year wise and once the plot is generated, find the year which has the highest sales and write the output to a file. The output should be written to /code/output.txt

Input Format
You have to read the dataset, sales.csv at the location  (/data/training/sales.csv) which has 3 columns  [‘month’, ‘year’, ‘sales’] 

Output Format
Write the year which has the highest sales to /code/output.txt file.

Note:
Generating plots: You can save any number of plots to `/code/output` directory. Note that only the plots saved in /code/output will be visible to you in your code editor.
Using matplotlib: To generate and view the plots, please ensure that you use Agg as the default backend.

import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

       2. Create subplots using 
f,(axis1,axis2) = matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=1)
Use the above defined variables in the plots by adding the arguments ax=axis1, ax=axis2
